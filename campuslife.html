Student life at the Institute
</h3>

A Students’ Gymkhana Council co-ordinates student activities. Members are elected by direct elections. Faculty advisors assist the Student Body. Co-curricular <br>
activities are an integral part of a student’s life in IIITG. Our winter semesters are abuzz with sports and a cultural fest – Yuvaan. Students compete in both outdoor(Football,<br>
Cricket, Kabaddi, Volleyball), indoor (Chess, Carom, Badminton, Table Tennis, arm-wrestling, computer games) and cultural events (singing, dance, play). Monsoon <br>semesters are relatively quiet with students concentrating on their studies. Students can explore urban life surrounding the institute in Guwahati. Some of the pictures
<br> of our student activities can be found here.
